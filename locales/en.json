      "adminPermissions": {
        "question": "Does Chronos require admin permissions in Jira?",
        "answer": "<p>Chronos technically connects with your account and not with your workspace. That means that it should work without admin permissions. It does require Jira worklogs to be enabled though and there are a few edge cases where admins can prevent usage of apps like Chronos.</p><p>If our time tracker doesn't work on your workspace then let us know and we will take a look at it. You can also request a refund through <a href='https://support.apple.com/118223' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Apples “report a problem” platform.</a></p>"

      "freeAlternative": {
        "question": "Why does this app cost money when there are free alternatives?",
        "answer": "<p>We know that there are apps with a similar feature set (e.g. Timkee) and recommend them if you are looking for a free alternative. We have also tried these and found them difficult to use and/or inadequate for our use case. For example, one feature that almost all of them are lacking is the ability to add multiple accounts.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that this is a side project of a relatively small team of two developers. All of our revenue is used for the Apple developer license, web hosting and our domain.</p><p>If you really want to try our app without paying for it, you can always clone our <a href='{SOURCE_CODE_URL}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>GitHub repository</a> and build it yourself.</p>"
